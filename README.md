# CPNT260 css framework lab:

Lab summary: In this assignment, we will choose two components to implement on separate HTML pages, using Bootstrap for one and Tailwind CSS for the other. The components we can select from include a carousel, accordion, pricing table, modal, navbar with dropdown, tabbed content, and a card with a hover effect.

Each component will have a creative challenge, such as customizing the carousel with unique transitions, adding hover effects to the accordion, or highlighting a featured pricing option in the pricing table. We also need to ensure that our designs are tailored to match the theme of our project.

Accessibility is crucial, so we must make sure that all components are usable for everyone by incorporating ARIA attributes, ensuring keyboard navigation works, and providing alt text for images. Finally, it's important that both components are fully responsive across different devices, which we can test by resizing our browser window or using developer tools.

This project will help us practice our skills in implementing responsive web components while also considering usability and design.
